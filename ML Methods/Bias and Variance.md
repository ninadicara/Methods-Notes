High Variance = overfitting
High Bias = underfitting

## Trouble Shooting

Ways we might treat over fitting: 
1. [[Cross-Validation]]
2. Train with more data
3. Remove features ([[Feature Engineering]])
4. Early stopping
5. [[Regularisation]]
6. Ensembling 

Ways to treat underfitting:
1. Add more features ([Feature Engineering])
2. Use more data

## Bias v Variance Trade Off
