Mediator -the route through which an independent variable impacts the dependent variable. 

It is linked to causal analysis where A -> B -> C with B as the mediator. Without B there might be no relationship between A and C. 

Moderator - the level that the relationship between independent and dependent variables change as a function of a third variable (moderator). 
Moderators are sometimes referred to as 'interactions'. 

Moderators can make the relationship stronger or weaker.
