A.K.A. Variability, Spread

The extent to which a distribution is spread out. 

## Variance

To calculate the variance: 
- Calculate the mean of a sample,
- Work out how much each sample observation differs from the mean (deviations),
- Square each deviation, otherwise they'll all cancel each other out,
- Take the mean of the deviations.

However, variance is not very interpretable because it measures everything in the unit of measurement _squared_. Hence why we often use the [[#Standard Deviation]]. 

## Standard Deviation

Square root of the [[#Variance]]. 
A measure of the variability of the population. 

>[!important] For data with a _normal distribution_ approximately 95% of individuals will have values within 2 Standard Deviations of the mean.

The Standard Deviation is used to calculate [[Error|Standard Error]]. 

Any value in a distribution can be expressed as so many SDs above or below a mean.


### Normal Distribution

When the distribution is _normal_ we can use knowledge of the normal curve to estimate how many observations lie between any two given values. 

This is because the standard deviation slices up a normal distribution into 'standard'-sized slices, where each slice contains a known percentage of the total observations. 

For example, we know that 34% of all observations lie within 1SD either side of the mean. So in total 68% (_about two thirds_) of observations lie within 1SD of the mean if we take the positive and negative sides. 

95% of all observations lie within 1.96 Standard Deviations of the mean.
