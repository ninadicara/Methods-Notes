## Power Analysis 

Power is the probability of detecting an effect if there is a true effect present to detect. 
It helps to determine the smallest sample size that is suitable to detect an effect of a given test at the desired level of significance.

- Purpose is to protect against Type II [[Error (TO DO)]]s. 

Alpha is the p-value threshold we want to use. 
Power (%) is usually about 80%.
